Recipes Project

This is my first The Odin Project, project. I hope to test my newly learned skills and get more familiar with Git and committing the project. The Git aspect is currently very overwhelming for me and I hope to make it less so.


Project Update: I've now added a stylesheet and have started styling my page with CSS. This is a work in progress. I have a vision for how I would like it to look once I've built some more knowledge.
